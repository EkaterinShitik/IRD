# IRD_prediction_assessment
Inherited retinal degenerations (IRD) are heterogeneous disease groups that are frequently caused by a combination of deep-intronic variants (DIVs). In general, such DIVs are tightly associated with splicing disruptions that include cryptic splice sites. In this project, we have benchmarked the existing tools to evaluate the contribution of various DIVs to the development of IRD.
## Data
Overall, 206 DIVs involving 103 pathogenic and 103 benign were explored. The minimum dictance for pathogenic variants from exon-intron junction is 160 bp, for benign variants - 196 bp. Some of the datasets are intersected therefore the sum of pathogenetic variants does not amount to 103. Analysis was performed using GRCh38 genome assembly.

**Pathogenic**

- 51: experimental data that were provided by Marianna Weener (see Contacts)✦

**Benign**

To explore in more detail the dataset was divided into two sets of 57✧ and 54✦ variants.
