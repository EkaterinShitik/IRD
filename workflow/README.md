# Workflow steps

Folders store VCF files at a particular stage of processing and the commands used to get them. 

The final files processed with VETA are stored in `final` and have been analysed in the `data_analysis` notebook.

To replicate our work start with environments creation([conda]()/[mamba]()):
```bash
mamba env create -f requirements.yaml
```
